### SHELL VS KERNEL

The dictionary meaning of _KERNEL_ is _Core_, and _SHELL_ is _Surroundings_. So, what is KERNEL and SHELL?

According to this image, Shell is in the form of enclosing the Kernel, and Kernel is also enclosing the hardware. So, we can guess that something we type an command on Shell will be transferred to Kernel, and Kernel gives back the output to Shell with the words that we can understand. It's because we hard to control Kernel directly, so we use command that we can understand easily on Shell. 

Well, if we use only one Shell, it is hard to differentiate between Shell and Kernel. So we are going to use variable shells to differentiate them easily.
