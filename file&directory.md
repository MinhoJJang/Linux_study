# file & directory

## pwd 
**Print Working Directory**
Shows my current directory location.
``` 
~$ pwd 
/home/mhj
```

## ls
**List Segments**
Shows everyting in my current directory. Directory is bolder than file.

- ls -i
**-i, --inode = print the index number of each file**
Shows lists of everything inside.

## mkdir 
**Make Directory** 
Make folder in current diretory location.

## touch
```
touch example.txt 
``` 
Like this way, 'touch' can makes files in my current directory.

## cd 
**Change Directory**
```
cd dir1
``` 
It changes directory which I typed.

## clear 
It clears the board. 

## rm
**Remove**

```
rm [file name]
``` 
But it can't remove directory. So...
```
rm -r [dir name]
```
It removes everything recursively in the directory. Since '-r' is should be used carefully
