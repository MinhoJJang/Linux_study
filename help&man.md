# help & man
Similarly, no matter what command it is, if you add --help, you will get a simple help with the command.

__Man__ gives detailed help to the command.
If you want to find a word in the command, type __/__ and only find and show it. 
For example, type __/sort__ and enter. Then syntax __sort__ is highlighted on your console.
And if you press **N**, you can only find the sort position and show it to them.
If you want to get out of **man**, press **Q** to get out.

All commands in Linux are some built-in program. So, if you look at the version through **--version**, you can see the version of the program that executes the command.

**Mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3** 
In this way, you can create a folder in the folder at once.
-p is equal to -persons.

In **ls** 
**-l** shows the internal files and directories.
**-a** shows all the hidden files and directories. Hidden files has '.' in front of file&directory name. 
And if you want to sort out the list that you've shown, let's go through **--help** and find sort.
If you do **-S**, sort it in order of file size.

So, if you say **ls-alS**,
It shows all hidden files in a list in the order of large file sizes.
