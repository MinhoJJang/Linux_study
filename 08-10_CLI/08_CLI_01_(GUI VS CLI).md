## GUI vs CLI

GUI is short for __Grapical User Interface__, and CLI is short for __Command Line Interface__.

GUI show computer commands grapically so we can use computer more easily. So it is more familiar to common users. But CLI show nothing on computer, so all that we can do is that learn commands and type it on CMD. Since CLI is hard to use well.

By the way, why we learn about CLI, in spite of GUI is much more easily to use computer? There is two representative reasons. 

+ First, what will use more energy? In this case, _energy_ means usage of CPU, MEMORY. Obviously, GUL will use much more energy than CLI. So, for non-common users, CLI is much better way to use computer well than GUI. 
+ Second, GUI is hard to make sequential work to automatically. But, CLI is much appropriate to make work automatically than GUI. So it can reduce the waste of time that occurs from waiting to download the previous work.
